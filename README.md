I participated in the 2017 Better with Pets Hackathon.  For my team's project, I wrote the backend API for a React front end application using Python and Redis, hosting it on Heroku.

I chose to use the [Hug](https://github.com/timothycrosley/hug) API framework as it's something I've had my eye on for simple API's and it did not disappoint.  I was pleased at the resulting API and would consider using Hug again over Flask for personal projects in the future.
